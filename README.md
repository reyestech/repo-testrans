# Splunk: Website Defacement
### Splunk IR Lab ‚Äî Website Defacement: From Signal to Root Cause
**Hector M. Reyes | Boss of the SOC** | `Date`

### TL;DR
- Confirmed **Po1s0n1vy** defacement of `imreallynotbatman.com`.
- Traced attack chain: **Acunetix scan ‚Üí CMS (Joomla) ‚Üí brute-force POSTs ‚Üí uploaded executable (3791.exe) ‚Üí defacement JPEG + dynamic DNS**.
- Captured IoCs and turned ad-hoc hunts into repeatable detections (alerts/dashboards).

**Key skills displayed:** SPL queries, web/HTTP log analysis, CMS fingerprinting, brute-force detection, threat-intel enrichment, and detection engineering.

## Scenario
Today is Alice's first day at Wayne Enterprises' Security Operations Center. Lucius sits Alice down and gives her the first assignment: A memo from the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). GCPD has found evidence online (http://pastebin.com/Gw6dWjS9) that the website www.imreallynotbatman.com hosted on Wayne Enterprises' IP address space has been compromised. The group has multiple objectives, but a key aspect of their modus operandi is defacing websites to embarrass their victim. Lucius has asked Alice to determine if www.imreallynotbatman.com (the personal blog of Wayne Corporation‚Äôs CEO) was compromised.

## üéØ Your Assignment (Objectives)
Investigate the suspected defacement of `imreallynotbatman.com`, prove the impact and timing, and map the attacker‚Äôs route and infrastructure. Produce IoCs and a repeatable set of searches/alerts for future incidents.  
- Confirm that a visible artifact was altered (defacement JPEG) and when.  
- Identify scanning activity, CMS/stack, and suspected upload/auth routes.  
- Attribute with infra signals (dynamic DNS/FQDNs, source IPs, filenames).  
- Quantify brute-force activity and credential success windows.  
- Package detections, containment actions, and hardening guidance.

## üìÇ Evidence Artifacts
These artifacts provide context/timeline to anchor your Splunk pivots.  
- **GCPD memo (Po1s0n1vy):** https://botscontent.netlify.app/v1/gcpd-poisonivy-memo.html  
- **Alice‚Äôs journal (Sep 1‚Äì13, 2016):** https://botscontent.netlify.app/v1/alice-journal.html  
- **Pastebin tip (defacement claim):** `http://pastebin.com/Gw6dWjS9`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Hunt Setup & Pre-Engagement
I staged the environment and scoped Splunk for focused hunts, then pivoted through HTTP/IDS and auth signals to prove defacement and trace root cause.

**Prep (Evidence Review):**
- Skim **GCPD memo** + **Alice‚Äôs journal** to bracket time and suspects.  
- Note candidate IoCs (IPs, FQDNs, filenames, hashes) for quick searches.  
- Plan pivots: HTTP content types, user-agents, POST/Upload paths, auth bursts.

**Splunk Hunt Setup:**
- **Time window:** Sep 1‚Äì13, 2016 ‚Üí tighten to exact defacement time once found.  
- **Primary asset(s):** `imreallynotbatman.com` ‚Ä¢ Web server `dest_ip ‚âà 192.168.250.70` (BOTS v1).  
- **Data sources:** `stream:http`, `suricata`, `stream:dns` (plus server logs if present).  

**Pro Tips:**
- Use the **Fields** sidebar (e.g., `src_ip`, `useragent`, `content_type`, `http_method`).  
- Save strong searches as **Reports** ‚Üí later convert to **Alerts/Dashboards**.  
- Track IoCs and timestamps in a scratchpad for quick cross-pivots.  
- Validate findings with screenshots and exact event times for handoff.

## TL;DR
- Proved ransomware activity on **we8105desk** by correlating **DNS**, **Suricata**, **Sysmon**, and **Windows Registry** telemetry.  
- Identified the **first suspicious domain**, **encryptor payload** (`mhtr.jpg`), **USB lure** (`MIRANDA_PRI`), **patient-zero IP**, and **file-server impact** (distinct PDFs encrypted).  
- Outcome: an operational **playbook** (detections + queries) for early signal, containment, and recovery.

üìö Lessons Learned ‚Äî Checklist

 Early DNS signals pay off: filtering benign domains exposes the first touchpoints.

 Process lineage matters: parent/child (VBS ‚Üí TMP) cuts through noise.

 Write-velocity baselines: spikes + new extensions are high-signal.

 Registry is gold for ingress: USB-friendly names confirm the lure.

 Quantify impact: distinct encrypted files guide triage & comms.

 Operationalize: convert queries into saved searches, alerts, and dashboards.

üèÅ Conclusion

This lab turns a messy outbreak into a timeline of compromise ‚Üí containment ‚Üí hardening. By correlating DNS, Suricata, Sysmon, and Registry artifacts, we identified patient-zero, traced payload delivery, measured impact on the file server, and produced repeatable detections.

The same rhythm applies in production: observe ‚Üí correlate ‚Üí validate ‚Üí harden. Practicing it here builds the muscle memory to respond faster when the stakes are real.

Next: Extend to Risk-Based Alerting (weight DNS + write spikes + lineage) and add SOAR actions for rapid isolation and backup validation.
